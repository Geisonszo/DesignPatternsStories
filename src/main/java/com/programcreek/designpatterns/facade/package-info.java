 * Description: Facade design pattern(外观模式)
 *  Facade design pattern hides complexity of
 *  a task and provides a simple interface.
 *  A very good example is the startup of a computer.
 *  When a computer starts up, it involves the work of
 *  cpu, memory, hard drive, etc. To make it easy to use
 *  for users, we can add a facade which wrap the complexity
 *  of the task, and provide one simple interface instead.
